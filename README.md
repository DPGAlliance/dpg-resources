## 🙋 Getting Started

Welcome, please select the starting point for your journey:

1. [I have a project that I want to make open source](#open-sourcing-your-project).
2. [I have an open-source solution, how can I make it a DPG](#becoming-a-digital-public-good)?
3. [My project is a DPG, how can I improve it](#improving-your-project)?

## 🔓 Open Sourcing Your Project

You can refer to the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project) for an in-depth approach to starting an open-source project. While open source is not a panacea, there are certain circumstances and problems to which it is very well suited and tailoring the format of your project to the goals resources, and environment of your organization can help make your project more successful. We encourage you to review this [Open Source Archetypes Framework](https://opentechstrategies.com/archetypes-files/open-source-archetypes-v2.pdf) to identify and articulate your open-source goals. Here are some _musts_ for an open-source project:

- **Source**: Have a public repository or platform where you can host your source code, data or content.
- **License**: Have a license that allows the code/data/content to be freely used, modified, and shared. 
- **Documentation**: Have some basic documentation for the community to be able to understand, access or contribute to your project.  
- **People**: Make sure you've talked to your legal department and your developer team.

## 🌍 Becoming a Digital Public Good

Digital public goods are **open software**, **open data**, **open AI systems**, and **open content collections** that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm, and are of high relevance for the attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To successfully become an accredited digital public good (DPG) you must adhere to the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard) and [submit an application](http://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/signup) for review to the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/governance).

To get started, use our [DPG Eligibility Tool](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility) to quickly determine if your digital solution can be nominated as a DPG. Once you know if your solution is eligible, read the [Submission Guide](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission-guide) for more information about the DPG application process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For detailed documentation on the evidence that needs to be provided for each type of digital public good, please refer to the [DPG Wiki](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/wiki). We strongly encourage all DPG applicants to use this Wiki while they fill out the [application form](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/signup).

If you have any questions, you can visit our [DPG Application FAQs](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/faqs) or ask directly to the [DPG Community](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-community/discussions/categories/q-a-help-wanted) for guidance; we're available to help.
