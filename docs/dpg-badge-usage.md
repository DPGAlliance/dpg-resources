## DPG Badge Usage

To show credibility, you can display your DPG Badge on key areas like:
- The hero/navigation section of your website or documentation pages.
- The footer section of your website or documentation pages.
- The top section of your source host README.md file or default page.
- The bottom section of your source host README.md file or default page.

Below are examples of how you can use the DPG Badge on the entry README file of your source hosting platform to show credibility and link users to your DPG profile page to verify your DPG status.

> [!TIP]
>
> With platforms like shields.io, you can add different static and dynamic badges to your repository's markdown README file to show different information like project status, code status, contributors status, usage status, and other key metric you want to highlight. If you don't use this yet, you should check it out.

## Header

In addition to any other badge you may have at the top of your README, you can add another using the following markdown or HTML code:

**Markdown**:
```markdown
[![DPG Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG-3333AB?logo=github)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug)
```

[![DPG Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG-3333AB?logo=github)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug)

**HTML**:
```html
<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG-3333AB?logo=github" alt="DPG Badge"></a>
```

<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG-3333AB?logo=github" alt="DPG Badge"></a>

Alternatively, you can include the year you became a DPG to show your experience in complying with the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard), like so:

```markdown
[![DPG Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG%20(Since%20%202022)-3333AB?logo=github)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug)
```

[![DPG Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verified-DPG%20(Since%20%202022)-3333AB?logo=github)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please ensure to replace `dpg-slug` with your DPG's profile page's URL slug (which you can find on the DPG Registry).

> [!TIP]
>
> We're also working to add `dpg` to the list of icons, so you can replace `github` in the source URL to `dpg`. We will update this guide once that is done. If you have any questions or need help, please let us know.

## Footer

You can add a centralized badge to the footer of your README file to show your DPG status and link to your DPG profile page. This badge can be added to the footer of your README file or any other documentation page you have. Here is an HTML example of how you can add the badge to the footer of your README file:

```html
<div align="center">

<br />
<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/r/dpg-slug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/blob/main/docs/assets/dpg-badge.png?raw=true" width="100" alt="Digital Public Goods Badge"></a>
