# CC Licenses for Content Collection DPGs

We encourage DPG applicants to use one of the Creative Commons licenses which allow for both derivatives and commercial reuse ([CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)), or dedicate content to the public domain ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0)). We also accept the following licenses which do not allow for commercial reuse: [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) and [CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0).

## License Restrictions

### Non-Commercial

A "noncommercial" restriction in a Creative Commons license, often denoted as "NC," means that the content covered by the license can be used, shared, and adapted by others for noncommercial purposes only. In other words, if a work is licensed under a Creative Commons license with a noncommercial restriction, you are free to use it for personal, educational, or nonprofit purposes, but you cannot use it for commercial activities without seeking additional permissions from the copyright holder.

We encourage DPGs to allow commercial reuse, but we allow NC licenses in case the owner desires to limit the for-profit use of this content.

### Non-Derivatives

A "Non-Derivatives" restriction in a Creative Commons license, often denoted as "ND," means that the content covered by the license cannot be modified, remixed, or used to create derivative works. In essence, if a work is licensed under a Creative Commons license with a non-derivative restriction, you are allowed to use the work as-is, but you cannot adapt, remix, or build upon it in any way.

ND licenses directly conflict with the open source principles as free redistribution is at the core of what a digital public good is. For this reason, we donâ€™t allow any ND-restricting licenses.

## Benefits of These Licenses

Using licenses which allow for both derivatives and commercial reuse offers the following benefits:

- **Broader Impact and Wide Distribution**: The DPG has the potential to reach a broader audience because it can be freely shared, remixed, and distributed. For example, it allows others to translate the content into other languages, increasing the usefulness and impact of the DPG.  
- **Increased Collaboration**: Encourages others to collaborate and share ownership of open content (such as content commons like Wikipedia), and trust that derivative work could be published on the same platforms/ media ensuring quality and control over what is shared.  
- **Rapid Improvement**: When others can create derivative works, they can identify errors or outdated information and correct them, leading to continuous improvement and updating of the content.  
- **Inspiration**: Open content can serve as an inspiration for others. Your work may lead to new ideas, projects, or research that wouldn't have been possible without the original contribution.  
- **Feedback Loop**: Derivative works can provide valuable feedback. They can highlight areas where your content is strong and where it can be improved, helping you refine your work.

## Mitigating Potential Risks Content Misuse

Here are some ways to mitigate potential risks and misuse of content:

- **Legal Protections From the License**: Open content licenses come with legal protections that ensure attribution, non-commercial use, and other conditions that can help safeguard your intellectual property rights.  
- **Clearly Defined Terms of Use**: You can have specific terms and conditions of use in your content's license. Specify how attribution should be given, whether commercial use is allowed, and limit the use of derivatives for unlawful purposes.  
- **Reviewing and flagging misuses**: Regularly monitor the use of your content. Tools and services like Google Alerts, reverse image search, or content tracking services can help you identify potential misuses.   
- **Utilizing Reporting Mechanisms**:  Many content DPGs have mechanisms for reporting copyright and licensing violations. If your content is being misused, other users can inform you about it.  
- **Watermarking and Metadata**:  Non-intrusive watermarking or embedding metadata into your content, makes it more difficult for others to misuse or claim it as their own.
- **Preserving the Rights of Copyright Holders**: The copyright holder still has authority over the commercial use of their work because of these licenses. In order to ensure that the copyright holder can monetize their work in commercial settings, anyone wishing to use the content for a for-profit endeavour must obtain additional authorization from the copyright holder or negotiate a separate license.
- **Equilibrium Between Control and Openness**: Through these licenses, a balance is struck between fostering open access and defending the rights of the author by permitting derivatives but prohibiting commercial use.  It promotes innovation and teamwork while safeguarding the potential revenue streams linked to commercial applications.
- **Recognition and Attribution**: The original creator must be given credit under the terms of the CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA licenses. This guarantees that the author will receive credit for any uses or adaptations of their work. It promotes transparency regarding the content's source while assisting in upholding the reputation and integrity of the creator.
- **Legal Clarity and Uniformity**: Creative Commons licenses are extensively recognized and applied. They offer uniform terms and conditions, which lessen the possibility of misunderstandings or disagreements over the permissible uses of the information. Both content authors and users gain from this legal clarity.
- **Community Engagement**: Through the usage of Creative Commons licenses, authors can interact with an international user base as well as the educational and content development community. This kind of interaction can result in constructive feedback, greater collaboration, and the expansion of knowledge and expertise.
