# DPG Resources 

An open approach to digital development can help to increase collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done. Programs can maximize their resources and ultimately their impact through open standards, open data, open source technologies, and open innovation. By taking advantage of existing investments when you are able, you can apply finite digital development resources toward creating global goods.

Below is a growing collection of general helpful resources for different digital public goods solution types. Kindly check out the [DPG Wiki](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/dpg-resources/wiki) for official requirements, resources, and best practices for each of the DPG Standard indicators.

## Open Software

- [What is Free Software?](https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) — “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.
- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) — A collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project. While these guides are specific for and by Github, many parts can be re-mixed and re-used for more general purposes.
- [Apache Project Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html) — A suggested framework for evaluating the overall maturity of an Apache project community and the codebase that it maintains. While this model is specific to Apache projects many of these factors are important for any open source project.
- [The Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net) — A set of criteria that supports public organizations in developing and maintaining software and policy together. The Standard describes several criteria with consistent sections that make it clear how to create great public code.
- [Linux Foundation Open Source Guides](https://linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides) — Leverage best practices for running an open source program office or starting an open source project in your organization.
- [Building and Reusing Open Source Tools for Government](https://newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/building-and-reusing-open-source-tools-government/) — A primer developed by the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative for any government entity thinking about embracing open source solutions.
- [Making source code open and reusable](https://gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable) — A manual from Gov.uk on how to make open source projects so that other developers (including those outside government) can benefit from your work and build on it, learn from your experiences and find uses for your code which you hadn’t found.

## Open Data

- [The Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/) — This handbook discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to open up data.
- [Publishing Open Government Data](https://w3.org/TR/gov-data/) — To help governments open and share their data, the W3C eGov Interest Group has developed the following guidelines.
- [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](https://dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/know-your-obligations/data-protection-impact-assessments) — This describes a process designed to identify risks arising out of the processing of personal data and to minimize these risks as far and as early as possible. DPIAs are important tools for negating risk, and for demonstrating compliance with the GDPR. Most EU countries will have a web page with resources on how to conduct one. For reference, refer to [the one from the UK](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/) which includes a document template that you can fill out.
- [The Value of Open Data Sharing](https://earthobservations.org/documents/dsp/20151130_the_value_of_open_data_sharing.pdf) — This GEO report is written specifically for those who believe that broad restrictions on access to and use of data are appropriate and good public policy, or who need more reasons to justify greater openness.
- [The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://dublincore.org/about) — An organization supporting innovation in metadata design and best practices across the metadata ecology.

## Open Content

- [The Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses) — A collection of licenses that give everyone from individual creators to large institutions a standardized way to grant the public permission to use their creative work under copyright law.
- [The Creative Commons Legal Database](https://legaldb.creativecommons.org) — A collection of case law and legal scholarship to help you learn more about legal issues surrounding Creative Commons (CC) licenses and legal tools.
- [The Open Education Handbook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Open_Education_Handbook) — This handbook has been written to provide a useful point of reference for readers with a range of different roles and interests who are interested in learning more about the concept of Open Education and to help them deal with a variety of practical situations.
- [Guidelines for open educational resources (OER) in higher education](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000213605) — These guidelines outline key issues and make suggestions for integrating OER into higher education to encourage decision-makers in governments and institutions to invest in the systematic production, adaptation and use of OER and to bring them into the mainstream of higher education in order to improve the quality of curricula and teaching and reduce costs.
