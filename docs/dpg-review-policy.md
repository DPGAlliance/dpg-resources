## Nomination Policy

- Owners of digital solutions who wish to get their solution recognized as a digital public good must nominate their solution by submitting a DPG application.
- An application can be created and submitted through the DPGA nomination portal at [app.digitalpublicgoods.net](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net).
- The set of questions that are asked as part of the application are transparently available [here](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard-questions.md).
- Applications can only be submitted by an authorised representative of the digital solution (the applicant).
- We collect the name and email address of the applicant. Email verification is required to submit an application.
- Each application is assigned a unique application ID.
- The content of each submitted application is made publicly available and licensed as such via Unlicense.

## Application Review Policy

- Each application is assessed against the latest version of the [DPG Standard](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard/blob/main/standard.md) at the time of creation of the application.
- The application must meet all the requirements of the DPG Standard to become a **DPG**.
- If the application fails to meet one or more requirements, it will be declared as **Ineligible**.
- If clarifications are requested and the applicant fails to respond within the time allotted, the application will be automatically declared **Ineligible**.
- Every review results in a binary decision: **DPG** or **Ineligible**.
- The final determination on whether a solution adheres to the DPG Standard will be made by the DPGA Secretariat’s Technical Coordinator.
- We anticipate each application to go through the entire review phase in 4-8 weeks. In some cases, this timeline will extend further due to increased pending backlogs or national holidays.
- A digital solution recognized as a DPG will be listed on the public [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) and their listing will also be made available to other databases via an API.

## DPG Registry Moderation Policy

- The public [DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) displays all digital solutions that are recognized as DPGs.
- Solutions that appear on the registry as DPGs will be notified and invited to use the DPG term and the DPG badge to describe the digital solution, promote their solution, and link to the DPG Registry.
- All of the information available on the DPG Registry is openly licensed and made accessible to any other entity wishing to display it via an API - as such information on the DPG registry may be mirrored or used by any number of other entities.
- On an ongoing basis, DPGs must always be able to demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals and use of an approved open license.
- If at any point a DPG is found to no longer use an open license or be relevant to the SDGs, it will be removed from the DPG Registry. To report a DPG that may no longer meet this criteria please email support@digitalpublicgoods.net.
- A DPG listing can also be removed at the request of the applicant.

## DPG Status Renewal Policy

- DPG status is valid for one year from the date of completion of review.
- To ensure that a DPG continues to comply with the latest DPG Standard, they must submit a Renewal application.
- Renewal applications will be automatically generated by the system 60 days before the DPG expires. The DPG product owner is only expected to log into the dashboard and update any missing or outdated information before the expiration date. If the DPG product owner does nothing before the expiration date, the application will be automatically submitted for review with the previously submitted information.
- Renewal applications must be edited via the [DPGA nomination portal](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net).
- Upon a re-review, if the solution is found to comply with the latest DPG Standard, it will stay listed on the DPG Registry.

## DPG Status Removal Policy 

- DPGA invites the community members to scrutinize the documentation submitted by DPG owners in order to validate their status as a DPG.
- The review team will deliberate on the issues raised and do either of the following 3 things: 
  1. Accept the reservations noted by the community and reach out to the DPG owner over email to seek clarification.
  2. Reject the reservations noted by the community and stick to the decision on validation of a DPG status. 
  3. Convene a meeting with the stakeholder who has raised concerns to get a more detailed explanation or additional information. 
- Please note that the final decision for DPG status validation rests with the DPG review team.

## Spam Policy

Any application that is deemed nonsensical, malicious, irrelevant, or in violation of our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will not be reviewed and will be removed immediately.
